            "**Why recruiters test this:** Percentages quietly power 8-10 of the ~25 quant questions in TCS NQT, Infosys and Cognizant papers — profit-loss, interest, mixtures and data interpretation are all percentage arithmetic in disguise. Master this one chapter and a third of the quant section opens up.\n\nA percentage is just a fraction with denominator 100. So **30% = 30/100 = 0.30**. When a question says \"x% of N\", the word **of means multiply**: x% of N = (x/100) x N.\n\nThe three-step method — use it every time:\n1. Convert the percentage to a fraction or decimal.\n2. Replace the word \"of\" with multiplication.\n3. Look for a fraction shortcut BEFORE multiplying.\n\nMemorise these pairs until they are instant:\n- 1/2 = 50%, 1/4 = 25%, 3/4 = 75%\n- 1/5 = 20%, 2/5 = 40%, 3/5 = 60%\n- 1/8 = 12.5%, 1/3 = 33.33%, 1/6 = 16.67%, 1/10 = 10%\n\n**Worked example:** Find 12.5% of 800. Recognise 12.5% = 1/8, so the answer is 800 / 8 = **100**. Three seconds, no long multiplication.\n\n**Worked example:** 18 is what percent of 72? Use A/B x 100 = 18/72 x 100 = **25%**. The number after the word \"of\" (here 72) ALWAYS goes in the denominator.\n\n**Common mistake:** Taking the wrong base. \"A is what % of B\" divides by B, but \"B is what % of A\" divides by A. Underline the number that follows \"of\" — that is your denominator, every single time.\n\n**Exam tip:** Toppers finish percentage questions in under 30 seconds because they translate 12.5% -> 1/8 and 16.67% -> 1/6 on sight. Drill the table above until conversion is automatic — speed here buys you time for the hard questions later in the paper.",

            "Percentage change has exactly one formula: **change% = (new - old) / old x 100**. The base is ALWAYS the old value. This is why a 20% rise followed by a 20% fall does NOT return to the start — the fall acts on a bigger base.\n\nFor two successive changes of a% then b%, use the one-line shortcut:\n1. Write both changes with their signs (increase +, decrease -).\n2. Apply **net = a + b + (a x b)/100**.\n3. The sign of the result tells you net increase or decrease.\n\n**Worked example:** A price rises 20% then falls 20%. Net = 20 - 20 + (20 x -20)/100 = **-4%**. In rupees: Rs 100 -> Rs 120 -> Rs 96. The money does NOT come back to 100 — this exact trap appears in nearly every TCS and Cognizant paper.\n\n**Worked example:** A value rises 10% then rises another 20%. Net = 10 + 20 + (10 x 20)/100 = **+32%**, not 30%. Successive increases compound.\n\nRatios are just fractions: a : b means a/b. To chain a : b and b : c into a : c:\n1. Scale both ratios so the shared term b becomes the same number (use the LCM).\n2. Read a : c directly from the scaled ratios.\n\n**Worked example:** a : b = 2 : 3 and b : c = 4 : 5. Make b = 12 in both: a : b = 8 : 12 and b : c = 12 : 15. So a : c = **8 : 15**.\n\n**Common mistake:** Averaging two percentages that sit on different bases — you cannot. 10% of the class and 20% of the school do not average to 15% of anything. Recover the actual counts first, then compute.\n\n**Exam tip:** Whenever you see \"successive\", reach for a + b + ab/100 instantly. It works for any two changes — two increases, two decreases, or one of each. For three changes, apply it twice.",

            "**Why recruiters test this:** Every company's aptitude paper has 2-4 speed questions — plain journeys, trains, or boats. They all come from ONE relation, so this is the best effort-to-marks ratio in quant.\n\nThe single formula: **Distance = Speed x Time**. Rearrange as needed: Speed = D/T, Time = D/S. Nothing else exists in this topic — every \"hard\" question is this formula plus a units trick or a relative-speed twist.\n\nSolve any question in this order:\n1. Write down what you know: D, S or T (two of the three).\n2. Fix the units FIRST — never mix km/h with metres and seconds.\n3. Apply the formula and sanity-check the size of the answer.\n\nUnit conversion you must know cold:\n- km/h -> m/s: multiply by **5/18**\n- m/s -> km/h: multiply by **18/5**\n\n**Worked example:** Convert 72 km/h to m/s: 72 x 5/18 = **20 m/s**. (Check: 72 km in 3600 s = 72000/3600 = 20. The shortcut is just this division pre-done.)\n\nAverage speed over EQUAL DISTANCES at speeds u and v is the **harmonic mean 2uv/(u + v)** — never the simple average. Why: the slower half takes longer, so it drags the average below the midpoint.\n\n**Worked example:** Half a trip at 40 km/h, half at 60 km/h. Average = 2 x 40 x 60 / (40 + 60) = 4800/100 = **48 km/h**, not 50. The exam will offer 50 as a trap option — recognise it and smile.\n\n**Common mistake:** Averaging speeds directly. (u + v)/2 only works when the TIMES are equal, not the distances. Read which one the question fixes.\n\n**Exam tip:** The moment a question mentions metres or seconds alongside km/h, convert before doing anything else. Most wrong answers in this topic are unit errors, not logic errors.",

            "Two moving bodies have a **relative speed** — the speed at which the gap between them changes:\n- **Same direction:** relative speed = DIFFERENCE of speeds (the faster one slowly gains).\n- **Opposite directions:** relative speed = SUM of speeds (they close the gap from both sides).\n\nTrain questions are about WHAT LENGTH gets covered:\n1. Crossing a pole, a person, or a tree -> the train covers its **own length** only.\n2. Crossing a platform or bridge -> the train covers **its length + the platform length**.\n3. Crossing another train -> **sum of both lengths**, at their relative speed.\n4. Then: time = total length / speed (in m/s!).\n\n**Worked example:** A 120 m train at 36 km/h crosses a pole. Convert: 36 km/h = 10 m/s. Time = 120/10 = **12 s**. The platform version: same train crosses a 80 m platform -> (120 + 80)/10 = **20 s**.\n\nBoats and streams — two lines to memorise:\n- **Downstream** (with the current): speed = boat + stream\n- **Upstream** (against the current): speed = boat - stream\n\nGiven downstream speed d and upstream speed u, recover the parts: **boat = (d + u)/2** and **stream = (d - u)/2**.\n\n**Worked example:** A man rows 20 km downstream in 2 h (so 10 km/h) and 12 km upstream in 3 h (so 4 km/h). Boat speed = (10 + 4)/2 = **7 km/h**; stream = (10 - 4)/2 = **3 km/h**.\n\n**Common mistake:** Forgetting the train's own length when it crosses a platform. \"Crosses the platform\" means the LAST coach clears the FAR end — the engine travels platform + train length.\n\n**Exam tip:** TCS and Wipro love the train-crosses-man-then-platform combo: two equations, two unknowns (length and speed).

            "**Why recruiters test this:** Profit-loss is the most reliably present topic in service-company papers — TCS, Wipro and Cognizant each carry 2-3 of these. Every single question reduces to one skill: knowing **which base the percentage sits on**.\n\nThe two base rules — tattoo these on your memory:\n1. **Profit% and Loss% always sit on the COST PRICE (CP).** Profit% = (SP - CP)/CP x 100, so SP = CP x (1 + profit%/100).\n2. **Discount always sits on the MARKED PRICE (MP).** SP = MP x (1 - discount%/100).\n\nWhy shops survive \"sales\": they mark UP from cost first, then discount from the marked price. A 40% markup followed by a 15% discount still leaves 1.40 x 0.85 = 1.19 -> **19% profit**.\n\n**Worked example:** CP = Rs 400, sold at 25% profit. SP = 400 x 1.25 = **Rs 500**.\n\n**Worked example:** A shirt marked Rs 1200 with a 10% discount sells at 1200 x 0.90 = **Rs 1080**. The discount acted on 1200 (marked price) — the shopkeeper's cost never entered the calculation.\n\n**Worked example (reverse direction):** Sold at Rs 575 with 15% profit — what was the cost? CP = 575 / 1.15 = **Rs 500**. To go backwards, DIVIDE by the multiplier; never subtract 15% of 575.\n\n**Common mistake:** Computing profit% on the selling price. If CP = 80 and SP = 100, profit% = 20/80 = 25%, NOT 20/100 = 20%. The exam always offers both numbers as options.\n\n**Exam tip:** Convert every percentage into a multiplier the moment you read it: 25% profit -> x1.25, 10% discount -> x0.90, 15% loss -> x0.85. Chain multipliers for multi-step problems and you will never lose track of the base.",

          body:
            "Interest is rent paid on money. The two flavours differ in ONE word: what the interest is calculated on.\n\n**Simple Interest (SI)** earns only on the original principal, every year: **SI = P x R x T / 100**. The interest is identical each year — a flat line.\n\n**Compound Interest (CI)** earns interest on the interest too: **Amount = P x (1 + R/100)^T**, so CI = Amount - P. The interest grows each year — a curve bending upward.\n\nFor the same P, R, T: CI >= SI always, and the gap widens with time.\n\n**Worked example:** P = Rs 1000, R = 10%, T = 2 years.\n- SI = 1000 x 10 x 2 / 100 = **Rs 200** (a flat Rs 100 per year).\n- CI: year 1 earns Rs 100; year 2 earns 10% of Rs 1100 = Rs 110. Total CI = **Rs 210**.\n- The Rs 10 gap is exactly interest-on-interest: 10% of year 1's Rs 100.\n\n**Shortcut:** For exactly 2 years, **CI - SI = P x (R/100)^2**. Check: 1000 x (0.1)^2 = Rs 10. This one line answers every \"difference between CI and SI\" question instantly.\n\n**Worked example (doubling):** A sum doubles in 4 years at CI. When does it become 8 times? 8 = 2^3, so three doubling periods: 4 x 3 = **12 years**. Count doublings — no formula needed.\n\n**Common mistake:** Using the SI formula on a CI question because it is easier. The words \"compounded\", \"compound interest\" or \"interest is reinvested\" force the power formula — no exceptions.\n\n**Exam tip:** Memorise the 2-year multipliers: 10% -> 1.21, 5% -> 1.1025, 20% -> 1.44. They cover most papers and save the full expansion every time.",

            "**Why recruiters test this:** Divisibility and unit-digit questions look scary (7^35!) but take under 20 seconds with the right rule — which is exactly why companies use them: they separate students who know the patterns from those who try to brute-force.\n\nDivisibility rules — check without dividing:\n- **By 2:** last digit is even.\n- **By 3:** digit sum is divisible by 3.\n- **By 4:** the last TWO digits form a number divisible by 4.\n- **By 5:** last digit is 0 or 5.\n- **By 8:** the last THREE digits form a number divisible by 8.\n- **By 9:** digit sum is divisible by 9.\n- **By 11:** the alternating sum of digits (units - tens + hundreds - ...) is 0 or divisible by 11.\n\n**Worked example:** Is 729 divisible by 9? Digit sum = 7 + 2 + 9 = 18, and 18 is divisible by 9 -> **yes**.\n\n**Worked example:** Is 1936 divisible by 4? Look at the last two digits only: 36 / 4 = 9 -> **yes**. The 19 in front is irrelevant.\n\nUnit digits of powers repeat in cycles of length at most 4:\n1. Write the cycle for the base's last digit (for 7: **7, 9, 3, 1**; for 3: 3, 9, 7, 1; for 2: 2, 4, 8, 6).\n2. Take the exponent mod 4.\n3. Pick that position in the cycle (a remainder of 0 means the 4th term).\n\n**Worked example:** Unit digit of 7^35. Cycle of 7 is 7, 9, 3, 1. Now 35 mod 4 = 3, so take the 3rd term -> **3**.\n\n**Common mistake:** Treating remainder 0 as the 1st term of the cycle. Exponent mod 4 = 0 means the FOURTH term. Unit digit of 7^36 is 1, not 7.\n\n**Exam tip:** Use the unit digit to eliminate options before any heavy work. If the answer must end in 3, kill every option that does not — often only one survives and you never multiply at all.",

            "HCF answers \"what is the largest piece that divides BOTH numbers?\" LCM answers \"what is the smallest number BOTH divide into?\" Real questions hide these in words: equal-sized groups and largest tile sizes are HCF; bells ringing together and traffic lights syncing are LCM.\n\nThe prime-factor method:\n1. Write each number as a product of primes.\n2. **HCF:** take the LOWEST power of each COMMON prime.\n3. **LCM:** take the HIGHEST power of EVERY prime that appears.\n\n**Worked example:** 36 = 2^2 x 3^2 and 48 = 2^4 x 3.\n- HCF = 2^2 x 3 = **12** (lowest powers of the shared primes 2 and 3).\n- LCM = 2^4 x 3^2 = **144** (highest power of each prime seen anywhere).\n\n**The identity (two numbers only):** HCF x LCM = product of the numbers. Check: 12 x 144 = 1728 = 36 x 48. Exams use this constantly — given any three of the four values, you can find the fourth in one division.\n\n**Worked example:** Two numbers have HCF 6 and LCM 72, and one number is 24. The other = (6 x 72)/24 = **18**.\n\n**Common mistake:** Swapping the rules — HCF takes the SMALLER powers, LCM the LARGER. Sanity check every time: HCF must be <= both numbers, LCM must be >= both. If your \"HCF\" is bigger than either number, you computed the LCM.\n\n**Exam tip:** Word problems: \"largest size/divides exactly/equal groups\" -> HCF. \"Smallest number/together again/common multiple\" -> LCM.

            "**Why recruiters test this:** Series questions open nearly every reasoning section — TCS, Infosys and Cognizant each carry 3-5. They are pure pattern recognition under time pressure, and a fixed checklist beats raw cleverness every time.\n\nRun this checklist IN ORDER and the rule reveals itself within seconds:\n1. **Constant difference?** Same number added each time (5, 8, 11, 14 -> +3).\n2. **Constant ratio?** Same number multiplied (4, 12, 36 -> x3).\n3. **Differences of differences?** The gaps themselves form a pattern.\n4. **Alternating?** Two separate series interleaved — check the odd terms and even terms separately.\n5. **Famous families?** Squares, cubes, primes, Fibonacci, factorials.\n\n**Worked example:** 2, 6, 12, 20, 30, ? Write the gaps underneath: 4, 6, 8, 10. The gaps grow by 2, so the next gap is 12 -> 30 + 12 = **42**. (Bonus: these are n^2 + n — both views give the same answer.)\n\n**Worked example (alternating):** 1, 10, 3, 20, 5, 30, ? The odd positions are 1, 3, 5 and the even positions are 10, 20, 30. The next term sits in the odd-position series: **7**.\n\n**For letter series:** convert letters to positions (A=1 ... Z=26) and run the same checklist on the numbers. AZ, BY, CX is just (1,26), (2,25), (3,24) — first letter +1, second letter -1.\n\n**Common mistake:** Forcing a single rule onto an interleaved series. If the gaps look chaotic but every SECOND gap looks clean, split the series into two and test each half.\n\n**Exam tip:** Physically write the gaps under the numbers — do not do it in your head. The pattern usually jumps out from the second row, and for hard series, from the third row (gaps of gaps).",

            "Certain number families appear in every placement season. Recognising them on sight converts a 90-second question into a 10-second one.\n\nThe families to know cold:\n- **Perfect squares:** 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100 ... (know them to 25^2 = 625)\n- **Perfect cubes:** 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216 ...\n- **Primes:** 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29 ...\n- **Fibonacci-style:** each term = sum of the previous two (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 ...)\n- **Factorials:** 1, 2, 6, 24, 120, 720 ...\n- **Mixed rules:** x2 then +1, or x3 then -2 — applied repeatedly.\n\n**Worked example:** 3, 6, 11, 18, 27, ? Gaps: 3, 5, 7, 9 — consecutive odd numbers, so the next gap is 11 -> 27 + 11 = **38**. (Equivalently each term is n^2 + 2.)\n\n**Worked example (mixed rule):** 5, 11, 23, 47, ? Test x2+1: 5 -> 11 ✓, 11 -> 23 ✓, 23 -> 47 ✓. Next: 47 x 2 + 1 = **95**. Always verify the rule on EVERY given transition before trusting it.\n\n**Worked example (near-family):** 2, 5, 10, 17, 26, ? Each term is n^2 + 1. Next: 36 + 1 = **37**. When numbers sit 1 or 2 away from squares or cubes, test the offset family.\n\n**Common mistake:** Verifying the rule on the first transition only. A rule that fits one step but not all steps is a coincidence, not a pattern — exams deliberately plant these.\n\n**Exam tip:** When a series grows FAST (roughly doubling or worse), think multiplication, powers or factorials. When it grows steadily, think addition and gap patterns. Growth speed is the quickest filter.",

            "**Why recruiters test this:** Blood relations measure whether you can hold a chain of facts steady under pressure — the same skill as tracing code or requirements. Students who solve these in their head get them wrong; students who draw get them right. It is that simple.\n\nThe drawing system — 20 seconds to set up, saves minutes:\n1. **+ for male, - for female** next to each name.\n2. **Horizontal double line** for spouses, **single horizontal line** for siblings.\n3. **Vertical line downward** for parent -> child.\n4. Decode the statement from the speaker OUTWARD, one phrase at a time.\n\nSimplify each phrase before drawing:\n- \"father's father\" = grandfather\n- \"mother's brother\" = maternal uncle\n- \"the only daughter of my mother\" = the speaker herself (if the speaker is female)\n- \"my father's only son\" = the speaker himself (if the speaker is male)\n\n**Worked example:** A woman points to a man and says, \"His mother is the only daughter of my mother.\" Decode the inner phrase first: the only daughter of her mother is the woman herself. Substitute: \"his mother is ME.\" So she is **his mother**. Most students answer \"sister\" because they never substituted — the substitution IS the method.\n\n**Worked example:** A is B's father; B is C's sister. A is the parent of both B and C, so A is **C's father**. (Note: C's gender is unknown, but A's relation to C does not depend on it.)\n\n**Common mistake:** Assuming gender. \"B is C's sister\" tells you B is female — it tells you NOTHING about C. Exams hang wrong options on exactly this.\n\n**Exam tip:** For \"pointing to a photograph\" questions, write the speaker at the bottom of your diagram and build upward. The phrase between \"pointing to\" and the verb is always the person you must identify.",

            "Direction questions are coordinate geometry wearing a story. Redraw the journey on a small compass sketch and the answer falls out.\n\nThe method:\n1. Draw a + with N at the top, E to the right. Mark the start point.\n2. Trace each move, drawing the path segment by segment.\n3. **Each left or right turn rotates the facing by 90 degrees:** facing North, a right turn faces East; another right faces South.\n4. At the end, measure the straight line from start to finish.\n\nShortest distance from start: if the net displacement is a units along one axis and b along the perpendicular axis, distance = **sqrt(a^2 + b^2)** (Pythagoras). Opposite moves cancel first: 5 km North then 2 km South nets to 3 km North.\n\n**Worked example:** Walk 3 km North, turn right, walk 4 km. You are 3 N and 4 E of the start: sqrt(9 + 16) = sqrt(25) = **5 km**. The 3-4-5 triangle is the most common exam triple — recognise it instantly (also 6-8-10 and 5-12-13).\n\n**Worked example (cancelling):** Walk 4 km North, 3 km East, then 4 km South. North and South cancel; you are exactly **3 km East** of the start. No Pythagoras needed when one axis nets to zero.\n\n**Common mistake:** Confusing the WALKER'S left/right with YOUR left/right on the page. Left and right are relative to the direction currently being faced. If it helps, physically rotate the page as the person turns.\n\n**Exam tip:** Sunrise/shadow variants: in the morning the sun is in the East, so shadows point West; in the evening shadows point East. A person facing North in the morning has their shadow on their LEFT (West).",

            "**Why recruiters test this:** Coding-decoding is pattern-matching at speed — Wipro, Accenture and Cognizant use 2-4 of these per paper. Almost every question is one of just three machine types, so identification is 90% of the work.\n\nThe three code types:\n1. **Letter-shift:** every letter moves a fixed amount along the alphabet. CAT -> DBU is +1 (C->D, A->B, T->U). Find the shift from ONE letter pair, verify on the rest, then apply.\n2. **Number coding:** letters map to positions A=1 ... Z=26. The code may be the positions themselves, their sum, or their product.\n3. **Reversal / substitution:** the word is written backwards (WORD -> DROW), or whole words swap meanings (\"sky is blue\" puzzles — track the mapping word by word).\n\n**Worked example:** If CAT -> DBU (+1 shift), then DOG -> D+1, O+1, G+1 = **EPH**.\n\n**Worked example (number code):** If CAT = 24, test the sum: C=3, A=1, T=20 -> 3+1+20 = 24 ✓. Then DOG = 4+15+7 = **26**.\n\n**Worked example (wrap-around):** With a +2 shift, Y -> A and Z -> B. The alphabet is a circle — count past Z back to A. Exams love putting Y or Z in the word precisely to catch students who forget this.\n\n**Common mistake:** Finding the shift from the first letter only and applying it blindly. If C->D is +1 but A->C is +2, the shift is positional (1st letter +1, 2nd letter +2 ...) — a different machine entirely. Verify EVERY letter before answering.\n\n**Exam tip:** Write the alphabet with positions at the top of your rough sheet the moment the section starts: A1 B2 C3 ... Z26. Every coding question for the next 20 minutes becomes simple arithmetic against that one line.",

            "A systematic 4-step routine cracks any code without guessing:\n1. Line up the word and its code letter-by-letter, vertically.\n2. Compute the shift for EACH position (code letter position minus original letter position).\n3. Read the shift pattern: all equal (+2, +2, +2) = fixed shift; increasing (+1, +2, +3) = positional shift; mirrored = reversal.\n4. Apply the confirmed pattern to the question word.\n\n**Worked example:** If FACE is coded 6-1-3-5, check the positions: F=6, A=1, C=3, E=5 — the code IS the letter positions. So HEAD = H8, E5, A1, D4 = **8-5-1-4**.\n\n**Worked example (positional shift):** If DOG -> EQJ, compute per position: D->E is +1, O->Q is +2, G->J is +3. The shift grows by position. Then CAT -> C+1, A+2, T+3 = **DCW**.\n\n**Worked example (mirror code):** A=Z, B=Y, C=X (position k maps to 27-k). Then CAB -> X, Z, Y = **XZY**. If shifts look like wild jumps that sum to 27, test the mirror.\n\n**Common mistake:** Overthinking reversal codes. If WORD -> DROW, the rule is \"write it backwards\" — nothing deeper. Spend 5 seconds checking reversal FIRST because it is instant to verify and exams use it more than students expect.\n\n**Exam tip:** When the question gives TWO coded examples, decode the rule from the first and VERIFY on the second before answering. A rule consistent across two examples is almost certainly the intended one.",

            "**Why recruiters test this:** Seating puzzles simulate requirement-juggling — holding 5-6 constraints simultaneously and finding the arrangement that satisfies all of them. Infosys and Accenture place these as their medium-hard reasoning anchors.\n\nThe order of operations:\n1. **Draw the seats first** — boxes for a row, a circle with positions for a round table.\n2. **Place absolute clues first:** \"A sits at the extreme left\", \"B is third from the right\" — these are fixed pins.\n3. **Then relative clues:** \"X is immediately left of Y\" — these attach to the pins.\n4. **Use negative clues last** (\"C is not adjacent to D\") to eliminate among remaining cases.\n\nLinear vs circular — the key differences:\n- In a circle, check whether people face the **centre** or **outward** — facing outward FLIPS everyone's left and right.\n- In a circle of n people, the seat directly opposite seat k is seat **k + n/2** (wrapping around).\n\n**Worked example:** 6 people around a circular table facing the centre. Opposite seat 2 = 2 + 3 = seat **5**. Facing the centre, seat 2's LEFT neighbour is seat 3 (clockwise) — left for the sitter is clockwise when facing inward.\n\n**Worked example (linear):** Five seats, A at the extreme left, C immediately right of A, B at the extreme right. Layout: A C _ _ B — the two flexible people fill seats 3 and 4 according to any remaining clue.\n\n**Common mistake:** Treating \"immediately right\" and \"somewhere to the right\" as the same clue. Immediately right = the very next seat. To the right = any later seat. Mixing these collapses valid cases or creates false contradictions.\n\n**Exam tip:** When a clue allows two placements, draw BOTH diagrams side by side and keep applying clues to both. The wrong one will contradict a later clue and die on its own — this is faster and safer than agonising over which branch is right.",

            "**Why recruiters test this:** Error-spotting is the highest-frequency verbal question in Wipro, Cognizant and Accenture papers, and 60-70% of all planted errors are subject-verb agreement. One rule family, huge mark share.\n\nThe master rule: **the verb agrees with the SUBJECT, not the nearest noun.** Exams deliberately park a plural noun right before the verb to mislead your ear.\n\nThe checking method:\n1. Find the verb.\n2. Ask \"who or what is doing this?\" — that is the subject.\n3. Mentally DELETE everything between subject and verb (usually an \"of the ...\" phrase).\n4. Match: singular subject -> singular verb.\n\n**Worked example:** \"The list of items IS on the desk.\" Delete \"of items\": the LIST is on the desk. 'Items' was bait — the subject is 'list', singular.\n\nSingular by rule — these ALWAYS take a singular verb:\n- each, every, either, neither, anyone, everyone, nobody\n- \"Each of the boys HAS a book\" — 'each' rules, not 'boys'.\n- 'The number of' is singular (\"The number of students IS rising\") but 'A number of' is plural (\"A number of students ARE absent\").\n\n**Worked example:** \"Neither the manager nor the employees WERE present.\" With neither...nor / either...or, the verb agrees with the NEARER subject — here 'employees' (plural) sits next to the verb, so 'were'.\n\n**Common mistake:** Trusting your ear instead of the rule. \"The quality of these products are good\" SOUNDS fine because 'products are' is a natural pair — but the subject is 'quality', so it must be 'IS good'. When ear and rule disagree, the rule wins.\n\n**Exam tip:** In error-spotting questions, jump straight to the verb and run the 4-step check before reading anything else. If agreement is clean, then look at tense and prepositions — in that order of likelihood.",

          body:
            "Tense errors and confusable word pairs are the second-biggest mark source in verbal sections — and they are fully learnable, unlike vocabulary luck.\n\nThe tense principle: **keep tense consistent within a sentence unless the time genuinely changes.** \"He SAID that he IS coming\" mixes past and present without reason — \"he said that he WAS coming.\"\n\nThe high-frequency tense patterns:\n1. **Present perfect + since/for:** \"He HAS WORKED here SINCE 2015\" (point in time) / \"FOR five years\" (duration).\n2. **Past perfect for the earlier of two past events:** \"The train HAD LEFT before I reached.\"\n3. **No 'will' in if-clauses:** \"If it RAINS, we will cancel\" — never \"if it will rain.\"\n\nConfusables recruiters love — drill this list:\n- **its** (possessive) vs **it's** (= it is)\n- **their / there / they're**\n- **affect** (verb: to influence) vs **effect** (noun: a result)\n- **fewer** (countable: fewer questions) vs **less** (uncountable: less time)\n- **since** (point in time) vs **for** (duration)\n- **between** (two things) vs **among** (three or more)\n\n**Worked example:** \"The new policy will ___ all employees.\" The blank is a VERB (to influence) -> **affect**. \"The ___ of the policy was immediate\" needs a NOUN -> **effect**. Verb = affect, noun = effect — the a/e initials match action/end-result.\n\n**Worked example:** \"There are ___ students this year than last.\" Students are countable -> **fewer**, not less. Supermarket signs say \"10 items or less\" — and they are wrong.\n\n**Common mistake:** Choosing by sound in its/it's questions. Expand the contraction aloud: \"the dog wagged IT IS tail\" is obviously wrong -> 'its'. The expansion test never fails.\n\n**Exam tip:** When two answer options differ by a single word, the question is almost certainly testing one of the confusable pairs above. Identify WHICH pair, recall the rule, and ignore how the options sound.",

            "**Why recruiters test this:** Every technical interviewer — Zoho, TCS Digital, Infosys — asks \"what is the complexity of your solution?\" within the first five minutes. Stating Big-O confidently, unprompted, is the cheapest way to sound like an engineer instead of a student.\n\nBig-O describes **how running time GROWS as the input n grows**. It ignores constants and machine speed — it captures the SHAPE of the growth.\n\nThe ladder, fastest to slowest:\n- **O(1)** — constant: same work regardless of n (array access by index, hash lookup).\n- **O(log n)** — halving: each step cuts the problem in half (binary search). For n = 1,000,000 that is only ~20 steps.\n- **O(n)** — linear: one pass over the data (a single loop, finding a max).\n- **O(n log n)** — the sorting tier (merge sort, quicksort average, built-in sorts).\n- **O(n^2)** — quadratic: a loop inside a loop (comparing every pair). Fine for n = 1,000; fatal for n = 1,000,000.\n\nHow to read complexity off code:\n1. A loop over n -> O(n).\n2. A loop INSIDE a loop, both over n -> O(n^2).\n3. Two loops one AFTER the other -> n + n = still O(n). Sequence adds; nesting multiplies.\n4. A loop that halves the range each step -> O(log n).\n\n**Worked example:** Two nested loops each running n times do n x n = **O(n^2)** work. But a loop over n containing a CONSTANT inner loop of 10 does 10n work = **O(n)** — the constant disappears.\n\n**Worked intuition:** Constraints tell you the required complexity. If n can be 10^5, an O(n^2) solution does 10^10 operations — far too slow (~1 second buys you about 10^8). You NEED O(n log n) or better. Read the constraints before choosing your approach.\n\n**Common mistake:** Calling two sequential loops O(n^2). Only nesting multiplies. Trace whether the second loop runs INSIDE each iteration of the first, or after it finishes.\n\n**Exam tip:** State complexity as part of your answer before being asked: \"This is O(n) time and O(1) space.\" Then offer the trade-off: \"I could trade memory for speed with a hash map.\" That one habit upgrades the whole interview.",

            "One idea upgrades more brute-force solutions than any other: a **hash set / hash map answers \"have I seen this value?\" in O(1) average time**. Nested loops that exist only to SEARCH can almost always be replaced by one pass plus a hash structure.\n\nThe recognition pattern — reach for hashing when the problem says:\n1. \"Find duplicates / find the first repeated element\"\n2. \"Count the frequency of each ...\"\n3. \"Do two numbers sum to a target?\"\n4. \"Has this element appeared before?\"\n\n**Worked example (Two-Sum):** Find two numbers adding to target 10 in [3, 8, 5, 2, 7].\n- Brute force: check every pair — O(n^2).\n- Hash way: walk once, storing seen values in a set. At each x, ask \"is (10 - x) already in the set?\" At 3: need 7, not seen. At 8: need 2, not seen. At 5: need 5, not seen. At 2: need 8 — SEEN ✓. Answer: (8, 2) in **O(n)** time, O(n) space.\n\n**Worked example (first repeated character):** For \"placement\": build counts in one pass {p:1, l:1, a:2, c:1, e:2, m:1, n:1, t:1}, then a second pass finds the first char with count > 1 -> **a**. Two linear passes = O(n), versus O(n^2) comparing every pair of positions.\n\nThe trade-off stated plainly: **you spend O(n) extra memory to delete a factor of n from the time.** For n = 100,000 that turns 10 billion operations into 200,000 — the interview answer is almost always \"worth it\", but SAY the trade-off aloud to show you see it.\n\n**Common mistake:** Writing a nested loop whose inner loop only checks \"does this value exist elsewhere?\" That inner loop IS a search — replace it with a set lookup and the solution drops a complexity tier.\n\n**Exam tip:** In Zoho and Infosys coding rounds, the brute-force version usually passes the visible test cases but times out on hidden large inputs. If your solution has nested loops over n, assume there is a hash (or sorting or two-pointer) version they expect — find it before submitting.",

Read the passage for its one main claim.\n2. For each conclusion option, ask: 'Can I prove this directly from the passage?'\n3. If yes and only yes → valid inference.\n4.

Note: integer division in most languages truncates — 7/2 = 3, not 3.5.\n- Comparison: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`.

This means: two functions can each have their own `int i = 0` without conflict.\n\n**Recursion:** A function that calls itself on a smaller sub-problem.\n- **Base case:** the simplest input that returns directly — do NOT forget this, it is what stops infinite recursion.\n- **Recursive case:** reduce towards the base case.\n\n**Worked example — factorial:**\n```\nint factorial(int n) {\n    if (n == 0) return 1;       // base case\n    return n * factorial(n-1);  // recursive case\n}\n// factorial(3) = 3 * factorial(2) = 3 * 2 * factorial(1) = 3 * 2 * 1 * 1 = 6\n```\n\n**The three rules of clean code (for freshers):**\n1. **One function, one job** — a function should do exactly one thing.\n2. **Meaningful names** — `calculateTotal` is better than `ct`.\n3. **Handle edge cases explicitly** — what if n=0? What if the array is empty?\n\n**Common mistake:** Recursion without a base case → infinite recursion → stack overflow.\n\n**Exam tip:** Any time you see 'write a function to compute X', first write the function signature and the base case.
